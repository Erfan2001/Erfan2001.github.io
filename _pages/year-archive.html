<h2>Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Isfahan </h2>
<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Hamidreza Baradaran Kashani <i>(November 2022-Present)</i></p>
* Developed a summarization approach for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, using word embeddings initialized with Glove weights.
* Researched the utilization of graph networks specific to each document, involving 300-dimensional words and 64-dimensional sentences, updating semantic node representations via graph attention networks.
* Implemented a classifier to label sentences as summaries (1) or not (0), followed by applying a softmax or maximum smooth function to select sentences based on a hyperparameter, resulting in document summaries.
* Applying convolutional neural networks (CNN) with various kernel sizes to capture n-grams.
